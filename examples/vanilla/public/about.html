      <p>ForgeCSS introduces ForgeLang, a lightweight DSL embedded directly into your React className strings. It lets you express responsive design using intuitive prefixes like desktop:mt-4 or mobile:text-sm, then compiles those tokens into real CSS. Instead of reinventing a utility framework, ForgeCSS builds on top of the styles you already have—reading your existing CSS utilities, extracting their declarations, and generating fully scoped media-query variants automatically. This means your design system stays in control while ForgeCSS handles the heavy lifting of responsive expansion.</p>
      <p class="mobile:fz-sm">The project was created for teams who love utility classes but want more expressive breakpoint logic without adopting a full Tailwind pipeline. By treating className as a parseable language rather than a plain string, ForgeCSS enables custom syntax, prefix extensions, and future transformations that can evolve with your codebase. It slots into any React project with minimal setup and produces predictable, deduplicated CSS output that mirrors your real styles. Think of it as a tiny compiler for responsive utilities—simple to adopt, endlessly flexible, and built for modern UI development.</p>
